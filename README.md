![Multiple Conversation Threads](docs/images/Screenshot-05.png)
_All conversations are stored locally on your device with full search capabilities, editable titles, and organized sidebar for easy access to your legal and business advisory history_

### üîí Privacy & Security

- ‚úÖ **Local storage** - API keys stored on your machine only
- ‚úÖ **Direct API calls** - no intermediaries or third-party servers
- ‚úÖ **Full control** - you own your data
- ‚úÖ **Secure credentials** - encrypted local storage

### üè¢ Why Use API Endpoints Instead of Consumer Apps?

Atticus uses **direct API access** to AI providers rather than consumer web apps (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, etc.). This architectural decision provides critical privacy and enterprise benefits:

#### **Privacy & Data Protection**

- **‚ùå Consumer Apps**: Your conversations are stored on provider servers, used for model training (unless opted out), and subject to provider data policies
- **‚úÖ API Endpoints**: Zero data retention by default - providers don't store or train on your API data per enterprise agreements

**Real Impact**: Sensitive legal documents, financial data, trade secrets, and client information stay private. No risk of your proprietary strategies appearing in future model training.

![PII Detection & Data Protection](docs/images/Screenshot-04.png)
_Atticus automatically detects PII and sensitive information, providing real-time warnings and anonymization options to protect confidential data before sending to AI providers_

#### **Enterprise Compliance**

- **‚ùå Consumer Apps**: Consumer-grade terms of service, no SLAs, limited compliance certifications
- **‚úÖ API Endpoints**: Enterprise agreements with GDPR/HIPAA compliance options, SOC 2 Type II certifications, BAAs available

**Real Impact**: Meet regulatory requirements for handling confidential client data, PII, and protected health information.

#### **Control & Auditability**

- **‚ùå Consumer Apps**: Limited visibility into data handling, hard to audit usage, conversations tied to personal accounts
- **‚úÖ API Endpoints**: Complete audit trails, usage tracking per API call, programmatic access control, local data storage

**Real Impact**: Full visibility for compliance audits, client billing justification, and internal security reviews.

#### **Cost & Flexibility**

- **‚ùå Consumer Apps**: Subscription per user ($20-200/mo), rate limits, restricted features, limited model selection
- **‚úÖ API Endpoints**: Pay only for what you use, access to all models including latest releases, no rate limit surprises

**Real Impact**: Better economics for variable usage patterns, access to specialized models, no paying for unused seats.

#### **Integration & Workflow**

- **‚ùå Consumer Apps**: Manual copy-paste workflows, browser-based only, no automation, siloed from your tools
- **‚úÖ API Endpoints**: Desktop application integration, automation capabilities, multi-provider flexibility, offline data storage

**Real Impact**: Professional workflow integration, use multiple AI providers simultaneously, maintain local conversation history.

**Bottom Line**: For legal and business advisory work involving confidential information, API endpoints provide the privacy guarantees, compliance certifications, and data control that consumer apps cannot match.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Disclosure

**CRITICAL**: Atticus provides **information, not advice**. Understanding the risks is essential:

**Major Risk Categories**:

1. **Unauthorized Practice of Law** - AI outputs are not legal advice (Residual Risk: HIGH)
2. **Accuracy & Reliability** - AI hallucinations and outdated information (Residual Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH)
3. **Data Privacy** - Third-party AI provider exposure (Residual Risk: MEDIUM)
4. **Professional Liability** - No insurance coverage for AI-generated outputs (Residual Risk: HIGH)
5. **Security Vulnerabilities** - API key theft, supply chain risks (Residual Risk: MEDIUM)

**Required Actions**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always verify** AI outputs with licensed professionals
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never rely solely** on Atticus for high-stakes decisions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Understand jurisdiction** - Laws vary significantly by location
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review third-party AI providers** - Each has different privacy policies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintain confidentiality** - Don't share sensitive client information
