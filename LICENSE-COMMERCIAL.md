## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I try before buying?

Yes! We offer a 30-day free trial of the commercial edition. Contact us to get started.

### What's the difference between open source and commercial?

The software is the same. The commercial license provides legal protections, support, and additional services that the Apache 2.0 license does not.

### Can I upgrade from Apache 2.0 to commercial later?

Absolutely! You can start with the open source version and upgrade to commercial licensing at any time.

### Do you offer educational or non-profit discounts?

Yes, we offer 50% discounts for accredited educational institutions and qualified non-profit organizations.

### Can I pay monthly instead of annually?

Monthly payment plans are available for Enterprise tier at a 20% premium over annual pricing.

### What happens if I don't renew?

You can continue using the version you have, but won't receive updates, support, or new features. Your license reverts to Apache 2.0 for that version.

### Is there a setup fee?

No setup fees for Tiers 1-2. Enterprise tier may include setup fees for custom deployments.

### Do you offer refunds?

Yes, pro-rated refunds are available within 90 days if you're not satisfied.

### Can I transfer my license?

Licenses are non-transferable without written approval, but we generally accommodate legitimate business transfers (mergers, acquisitions, etc.).

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept wire transfer, ACH, credit card, and purchase orders for qualified organizations.
