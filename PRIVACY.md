# Privacy & Data Protection Assessment

**Document Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025  
**Scope:** Comprehensive privacy analysis of Atticus AI legal and business advisory assistant

---

## Executive Summary

Atticus employs a **privacy-first architecture** where user data is stored locally and transmitted only to user-selected third-party AI providers. The application itself collects no telemetry, maintains no cloud infrastructure, and implements strong data isolation principles. However, privacy risks exist at the third-party provider level, requiring users to understand data flows and make informed choices.

**Privacy Model:** Local-First with User-Controlled Third-Party Integration

**Key Findings:**

- ✅ **Strong:** Local data storage, no telemetry, user data ownership
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Third-party AI provider data exposure, API key security
- ❌ **Weak:** Limited user guidance on data sensitivity classification

**Overall Privacy Rating:** 7.5/10 (Strong with Third-Party Dependencies)

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Conversation history   | User chat sessions                     | Local device (Electron storage)      | User-controlled (can delete anytime) |
| API keys               | Third-party AI provider authentication | Local device (encrypted OS keychain) | User-controlled                      |
| Provider configuration | User's AI provider settings            | Local device (JSON config file)      | User-controlled                      |
| Model preferences      | User's selected AI models              | Local device (JSON config file)      | User-controlled                      |
| Jurisdiction selection | User's applicable legal framework      | Local device (conversation metadata) | User-controlled                      |
| Practice area usage    | Detected legal/advisory areas          | Local device (conversation metadata) | User-controlled                      |

**No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is required to use Atticus.**

#### **Non-Personal Data**

- Application version (local only, not transmitted)
- Configuration file versions (local only)
- Practice area keywords (bundled with application)
- Provider templates (bundled with application)

#### **Data NOT Collected**

- ❌ No analytics or telemetry
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No crash reports (unless manually submitted by user)
- ❌ No geolocation data
- ❌ No device fingerprinting
- ❌ No tracking cookies or identifiers
- ❌ No email addresses or contact information
- ❌ No payment information (users pay providers directly)
- ❌ No user accounts or authentication

---

### 1.2 Local Storage Architecture

**Storage Mechanism:** Electron's secure storage APIs

- Windows: Encrypted credentials via Windows Credential Manager
- macOS: Encrypted keychain via Keychain Services
- Linux: Encrypted via Secret Service API (libsecret)

**Storage Locations:**

```
User Data Directory (OS-specific):
  Windows: C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Atticus\
  macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Atticus/
  Linux: ~/.config/Atticus/

Stored Files:
  - config.json (provider settings, not API keys)
  - conversations/*.json (chat history)
  - cache/ (temporary YAML config caching)
```

**Encryption:**

- **At Rest:** OS-level encryption (Windows BitLocker, macOS FileVault, Linux LUKS)
- **API Keys:** Encrypted via OS secure storage (not in plain text config files)
- **Conversations:** Stored in plain JSON (no application-level encryption)

**Security Considerations:**

- ✅ API keys stored separately from config files
- ✅ OS-level access controls apply
- ⚠️ Conversation data not encrypted at application level (relies on OS encryption)
- ⚠️ Temporary API key storage in config (\_tempApiKey field) for backward compatibility

---

### 1.3 Data Transmission

**Destinations:** User-selected third-party AI providers only

**Transmission Method:**

- Direct HTTPS API calls from Electron main process
- TLS 1.2+ encryption (provider-dependent)
- No proxy or intermediary servers

**Data Transmitted to AI Providers:**

- User's conversation messages (prompt text)
- System prompts (practice area context, instructions)
- Conversation history (for context in multi-turn conversations)
- API authentication credentials (user's API key)

**Data NOT Transmitted:**

- ❌ No data sent to Atticus developers or servers (none exist)
- ❌ No data sent to analytics services
- ❌ No data sent to crash reporting services
- ❌ No data sent to third parties except user-chosen AI provider

**Network Architecture:**

```
User Device (Atticus)
        ↓ HTTPS (user's API key)
Third-Party AI Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
        ↓ AI Provider's internal processing
AI Provider's servers/data centers
```

**No Atticus-controlled servers exist in this data flow.**

---

---

### 4.2 Moderate Privacy Risks

#### **Risk 6: Model Training on User Data (Provider-Dependent)**

**Likelihood:** LOW (most providers opt-out by default for API)  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (privacy violation, competitive intelligence leak)

**Mitigation:** User must review provider policies; some providers (Anthropic, Cohere) contractually prohibit training on API data.

---

#### **Risk 7: Conversation Context Accumulation**

**Likelihood:** HIGH (feature by design)  
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM (more data shared with provider over time)

**Mitigation:** Users can start new conversations; old context not shared.

**Recommendation:** Add "Clear Context" button to reset conversation without deleting history.

---

#### **Risk 8: Metadata Leakage**

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** LOW (patterns revealed even if content protected)

**Mitigation:** Limited metadata collected; timestamps and practice areas stored locally.

**Recommendation:** Option to disable practice area tracking for extra privacy.

---

### 4.3 Low Privacy Risks

#### **Risk 9: Supply Chain Compromise**

**Likelihood:** LOW  
**Impact:** HIGH if occurs

**Mitigation:** Open source code allows audit; npm package integrity checks; signed releases.

---

## 14. Conclusion

Atticus achieves **strong privacy posture** through architectural choices that eliminate centralized data collection, storage, and processing. The local-first design inherently protects user privacy better than cloud-based alternatives. However, users must understand that third-party AI provider integration introduces unavoidable privacy considerations.

### Privacy Strengths:

- ✅ No data collection by Atticus developers
- ✅ Local storage and user ownership
- ✅ No telemetry or tracking
- ✅ Multi-provider choice enables privacy preferences
- ✅ Open source transparency
- ✅ Strong regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA)

### Privacy Weaknesses:

- ⚠️ Third-party AI provider data exposure
- ⚠️ Limited user guidance on data sensitivity
- ⚠️ No application-level encryption (relies on OS)
- ⚠️ API key security depends on OS implementation
- ⚠️ Users may not understand privacy implications

### Privacy Commitment:

**Atticus will never:**

- Collect user data for developer purposes
- Implement telemetry without explicit opt-in
- Share user data with third parties (except user-chosen AI providers)
- Require user accounts or authentication
- Implement dark patterns to coerce data sharing
- Prioritize features over privacy protection

**Atticus will always:**

- Maintain local-first architecture
- Provide full transparency about data flows
- Give users complete control over their data
- Comply with applicable privacy regulations
- Enhance privacy protections over time
- Respect user autonomy and informed consent

**Privacy is not a feature to be added—it is a principle embedded in Atticus's architecture from inception.**
